\title{Calculate at-risk table}
\usage{
find_at_risk(formula, data, include_cens = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Formula object. The response (on the left of the \code{~} operator) must be a survival object as returned by the \code{Surv} function.
The terms (on the right of the \code{~} operator) must include the treatment arm indicator, and additionally can include strata using the \code{strata} function.}

\item{data}{Data frame containing time-to-event data.}

\item{include_cens}{Boolean indicating whether to include values corresponding to censoring times}
}
\value{
Data frame
}
\description{
This function calculates the number of individuals at risk and number of events at each distinct event time
(and censoring time if \code{include_cens==TRUE}).
}
\details{
Returns a data frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item time \code{t_j}
\item number of events in each of the treatments at \code{t_j}
\item combined number of events in both treatments at event time \code{t_j}
\item number of individuals at risk in each of the treatment groups just before time \code{t_j}
\item combined number of individuals at risk in both treatment groups just before time \code{t_j}
}

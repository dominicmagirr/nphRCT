See Magirr and Burman (2019) and Magirr (2021) for details about the weighted log-rank tests, and in particular the modestly weighted log-rank test. This vignette works through an example of using the package to simulate data and perform weighted log-rank tests. A summary of the formulas used within this package is presented.


## Simulate a dataset

This package can be used to simulate a dataset for a two-arm RCT with delayed separation of survival curves by using the `sim_events_delay` function.

There are two parts to simulating the event times and statuses: the event model (parameters defined in `event_model`) and the recruitment model (parameters defined in `recruitment_model`).

Firstly, looking at the event model. The function `sim_events_delay` assumes that the survival times on the control and exponential arm follow a piecewise exponential distribution. Given rate parameter $\lambda$, the exponential distribution has the form:

\[
f(t)=\lambda \exp(-\lambda t)
\]

The rate parameters are set using the argument `lambda_c` for the control arm and `lambda_e` for the experimental arm. To use the piecewise version, this argument is set to a vector with length corresponding to the number of pieces. The duration of each piece is set using parameter `duration_c` and `duration_e`.

Secondly, looking at the recruitment model. The recruitment can be modelled using either a power model or a piecewise constant model. See `help(sim_events_delay)` more details about this models.

Additionally, the `sim_events_delay` function censors all observations at the calendar time `max_cal_t`.

Here we create a simulated dataset with 5 individuals on each arm. Assume that one unit of time is equal to one month. From entering the study until 6 months both arms have the same $\lambda$ parameter, with a median event time of 9 months. From 6 months, the experimental arm has a lower hazard rate, with a median event time of 18 months. Setting `rec_period = 12` and `rec_power = 1` means that individuals are recruited at a uniform rate over 12 months.

```{r 1}
library(wlrt)
set.seed(1)
sim_data <- sim_events_delay(
  event_model=list(
    duration_c = 36,
    duration_e = c(12 ,24),
    lambda_c = log(2)/9,
    lambda_e = c(log(2)/9,log(2)/18)),
  recruitment_model=list(
    rec_model="power",
    rec_period=12,
    rec_power=1),
  n_c=5,
  n_e=5,
  max_cal_t = 36
)
sim_data
```

## Weighted log-rank tests

Now that we have simulated a dataset, we will look at performing the weighted log-rank tests.

Consider the ordered, distinct event times $t_1, \dots, t_k$. Let $d_{0,j}$ and $d_{1,j}$ be the number of events at event time $t_{j}$ on each of the arms respectively, and let $d_{j}$ be equal to the sum of these two values. Similarly, let $n_{0,j}$ and $n_{1,j}$ be the number at risk at event time $t_{j}$ on each of the arms respectively, and let $n_{j}$ be equal to the sum of these two values.

The function `find_at_risk` can be used to calculate these values for a dataset.

```{r 2}
find_at_risk(formula=Surv(event_time,event_status)~group,
  data=sim_data,
  include_cens=FALSE)
```

Here, each row relates to the distinct event times $t_j$, which are specified in column `t_j`. The value $d_{0,j}$ relates to the column `n_event_control`, $d_{1,j}$ to `n_event_experimental`, and $d_{j}$ to `n_event`. Similarly, $n_{0,j}$ relates to column `n_risk_control`, $n_{1,j}$ to `n_risk_experimental`, and $n_{j}$ to `n_risk`.

To calculate the test statistics for a weighted log-rank test, we need to evaluate the observed number of events on one arm, e.g. $d_{0,j}$, and the expected number of events on the same arm, e.g. $d_j \frac{n_{0,j}}{n_j}$ at each $t_j$. The test statistic $U^W$ is then a weighted sum (using weights $w_j$) of the difference of these values:

\[
U^W = \sum_{j=1}^k w_j \left(d_{0,j} - d_j \frac{n_{0,j}}{n_j}\right)
\]

The weights $w_j$ that are used depend on the type of weighted log-rank test, these are described next.

### Weights

Three types of weighted log rank test are available in this package.

- The standard log-rank test uses weights:
\[
w_j=1
\]

The values of the weights in the log-rank test can be calculated using the function `find_weights` with argument `method="lr"`. In the case of the standard log-rank test, the weights are clearly very simple.

```{r 3}
find_weights(formula=Surv(event_time,event_status)~group,
  data=sim_data,
  method="lr",
  include_cens = FALSE)
```

- The Fleming-Harrington ($\rho$,$\gamma$) test uses weights:
\[
w_j = \hat{S}(t_{j}-) ^ \rho (1 - \hat{S}(t_{j}-)) ^ \gamma
\]
where $\hat{S}(t)$ is the Kaplan Meier estimate of the survival curve in the pooled data (both treatment arms) and time $t_j-$ is the time just before $t_j$.
There is the matter of choosing $\rho$ and $\gamma$. A popular choice is $\rho=0$ and $\gamma=1$ which means that the weights are equal to 1 minus the Kaplan Meier estimate of the survival curve.

Again the weights can be calculated using the `find_weights` function and setting `method="fh"`, along with arguments `rho` and `gamma`.

```{r 4}
find_weights(formula=Surv(event_time,event_status)~group,
  data=sim_data,
  method="fh",
  rho = 0,
  gamma= 1,
  include_cens = FALSE)
```

- The modestly weighted log-rank test uses weights:
\[
w_j = 1 / \max{\{\hat{S}(t_{j}-), \hat{S}(t^\ast)\}}
\]
There is the matter of choosing $t^\ast$ or alternatively choosing the value of $\hat{S}(t^\ast)$. See Magirr (2021) for a discussion on this.


```{r 5}
find_weights(formula=Surv(event_time,event_status)~group,
  data=sim_data,
  method="mw",
  s_star = 0.5,
  include_cens = FALSE)
```

### Test statistic 

Under the null hypothesis that the survival curves of the two treatment arms are equal, the distribution of $U^W$ is

\[
U^W \sim N\left( 0, V^W \right)
\]

where the variance, $V^W$, is equal to
\[
\sum_{j=1}^k w_j^2\frac{n_{0,j}n_{1,j} d_j (n_j - d_j)}{n_j^2(n_j-1)}
\]

The Z-statistic is then simply calculated in the usual way by dividing the test statistic $U$ by the square root of its variance.

To perform the full weighted log-rank test, use the function `wlrt` which outputs the test statistic, its variance, the Z-statistic and the name of the treatment group (in column `group`) which is selected to calculate the observed and expected values for in the weighted log-rank test formula.

```{r 6}
wlrt(formula=Surv(event_time,event_status)~group,
  data=sim_data,
  method="mw",
  s_star = 0.5)
```

### Permutation test and scores

Leton and Zuluaga (2001) showed that every weighted log-rank test can be written as either
an observed-minus-expected test (as described above), or as a permutation test.

The weights can be reformulated as scores for a permutation test using the following formula for the censoring scores and event scores respectively:

\[
C_j=-\sum_{i=1}w_i\frac{d_i}{n_i}
\]

\[
c_j=C_j+w_j
\]

These scores can be calculated using the function `find_scores` in the following way. Plotting these scores against the rank of the event times provides an intuitive explanation of the issues of using the Fleming-Harrington test, see Magirr (2021).

```{r 7}
df_scores_mw<-find_scores(formula=Surv(event_time,event_status)~group,
  data=sim_data,
  method="mw",
  s_star = 0.5)
plot(df_scores_mw)
df_scores_fh<-find_scores(formula=Surv(event_time,event_status)~group,
  data=sim_data,
  method="fh",
  rho = 0,
  gamma=1)
plot(df_scores_fh)
```



### Stratification

The issue of stratification when performing weighted log-rank tests is discussed in Magirr and Jiménez (2022). They explore various approaches to combining the results of stratified analyses. In particular they recommend combining on the Z-statistic scale, i.e. for the case of two strata, first express the stratified log-rank test as a linear combination of standardized Z-statistics, $\sqrt{V_1}Z_1+\sqrt{V_2}Z_2 \sim N(0,V_1+V_2)$. $V_1$ and $V_2$ are the variances for the log-rank test statistic on the first and second stratum respectively, and $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are the Z-statistics for the log-rank test statistic on the first and second stratum respectively. Secondly, the Z-statistics $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are replaced by the Z-statistics from the weighted log-rank test.

\[
\tilde{U}^W=\sqrt{V_1}\left( \frac{U_1^W}{\sqrt{V_1^W}}\right)+\sqrt{V_2}\left( \frac{U_2^W}{\sqrt{V_2^W}}\right)
\]

Here we introduce a strata `ecog` that has different $\lambda$ parameters, and demonstrate that it is simple to perform the described stratified weighted log-rank test.

```{r 8}
sim_data_0 <- sim_data
sim_data_0$ecog=0
sim_data_1 <- sim_events_delay(
  event_model=list(
    duration_c = 36,
    duration_e = c(6,30),
    lambda_c = log(2)/6,
    lambda_e = c(log(2)/6,log(2)/12)),
  recruitment_model=list(
    rec_model="power",
    rec_period=12,
    rec_power=1),
  n_c=5,
  n_e=5,
  max_cal_t = 36
)
sim_data_1$ecog=1
sim_data_strata<-rbind(sim_data_0,sim_data_1)
wlrt(formula=Surv(event_time,event_status)~group+strata(ecog),
  data=sim_data_strata,
  method="mw",
  t_star = 4
)
```

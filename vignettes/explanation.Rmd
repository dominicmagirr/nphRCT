## A simple randomized controlled trial

Consider a simple randomized controlled trial in which $N$ patients are randomized between treatment $1$ and treatment $0$ (let $Z_i$ denote treatment assignment for patient $i$). Each patient contributes a response $Y_i$, and we are primarily interested in the difference in means on the two treatments,

$$S:= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i \mathbb{I}(Z_i = 1)}{\sum_{i=1}^N  \mathbb{I}(Z_i = 1)} - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i \mathbb{I}(Z_i = 0)}{\sum_{i=1}^N  \mathbb{I}(Z_i = 0)}.$$
  
If this statistic is large then we would consider that evidence in favour of treatment $A$.

## Time-to-event outcome

If we have a time-to-event outcomes $(T_i, \delta_i)$, where $T_i = \min(\tilde{T}_i, C_i)$ is the follow-up time (the minimum of the time-to-event-of-interest and time-to-censoring) and $\delta_i = \mathbb{I}\{\tilde{T}_i < C_i\}$, then since the outcome is two dimensional we cannot simply compare the treatments via a difference in means. 


## ...Unless

Unless we first make a transformation of the two-dimensional outcome space to a one-dimensional "score", and then compare the mean "score" on the two arms. It turns out that a large number of test statistics that are commonly used in time-to-event settings can be expressed in this way:
  
- log-rank statistics
- weighted log-rank statistic
- difference in restricted mean survival times
- difference in milestone survival 

## What do the scores look like?

Let's take the example of the log-rank statistic applied to the data from the POPLAR study [(Gandara et al.)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0134-3).


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(nphRCT)
library(dplyr)
library(survival)

template <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")
httr::GET(url = "https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-018-0134-3/MediaObjects/41591_2018_134_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx", httr::write_disk(template))
poplar <- readxl::read_excel(template,
                   sheet = 2)


df <- poplar %>% 
  select(PtID, ECOGGR, OS, OS.CNSR, TRT01P) %>%
  mutate(event = -1 * (OS.CNSR - 1),
         time = OS,
         arm = ifelse(TRT01P == "Docetaxel", "control", "experimental")) %>% 
  select(time, event, arm) %>%
  as.data.frame()

km <- survfit(Surv(time, event) ~ arm,
                  data = df)

p_km <- survminer::ggsurvplot(km, 
                      data = df, 
                      risk.table = TRUE, 
                      break.x.by = 6,
                      legend.title = "",
                      xlab = "Time (months)",
                      ylab = "Overall survival",
                      risk.table.fontsize = 4,
                      legend = c(0.8,0.8))

df_lr <- find_scores(formula=Surv(time, event) ~ arm, 
                     data=df,
                     method = "lr")

p_lrt <- plot(df_lr,title="Log rank")

cowplot::plot_grid(p_km[[1]],p_lrt,rel_widths=c(2,3))
```


In the graph on the right-hand side, each dot corresponds to a patient in the trial. On the x-axis is the patients' follow-up time and on the y-axis is the score assigned to each observation. The dots form two approximately parallel lines. The top line corresponds to observed events; the bottom line corresponds to censored observations. An observed event close to time zero receives a score close to 1; a censored observation at around month 24 gets a score of -1; intermediate outcomes receive an intermediate score (the scores have been shifted and scaled to range between 1 and -1). The mean score on the two treatment arms are indicated with horizontal lines. The difference in mean score *is* the log-rank statistic (or, more precisely, a re-scaled version of it).


## Why is this interesting?

I think this perspective becomes helpful when we start to compare alternative test statistics. One popular approach in the context of non-proportional hazards is to base inference on the difference in restricted mean survival times (RMST) on the two arms (based on the Kaplan-Meier estimates). If we express the corresponding test statistic as a difference in scores (following [Andersen et el.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.7297)),  we see that every observation after the restriction time (in this case 18 months) get the same score. So an observed event at month 18 receives the same score as a censored observation at 24 months, for example.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_rmst_pseudo <- find_scores(formula=Surv(time, event) ~ arm, 
                     tau=18,
                     data=df,
                     method = "rmst")
p_rmst <- plot(df_rmst_pseudo, title = "RMST")
cowplot::plot_grid(p_km[[1]],p_rmst,rel_widths=c(2,3))
```

Next we might try a statistic based on the difference in milestone survival probabilities at 18 months (via the Kaplan-Meier estimates), which is almost like giving everyone with an event prior to 18 months a score of 1 and everyone still alive at 18 months a score of -1 (there is a small correction for censoring).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_milestone_pseudo <- find_scores(formula=Surv(time, event) ~ arm, 
                     tau=18,
                     data=df,
                     method = "ms")
p_surv <- plot(df_milestone_pseudo, title = "Milestone")
cowplot::plot_grid(p_km[[1]],p_surv,rel_widths=c(2,3))
```

## Weighted log-rank tests

Weighted log-rank tests can also be compared in this framework. For example, a [modestly-weighted log-rank test](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.8186) ($t^*= 9$).


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_mwlrt <- find_scores(formula=Surv(time, event) ~ arm, 
                     data=df,
                     t_star=9,
                     method = "mw")
p_mwlrt <- plot(df_mwlrt,title="MWLRT")
cowplot::plot_grid(p_km[[1]],p_mwlrt,rel_widths=c(2,3))
```

This might be thought of as intermediate between a log-rank test and a milestone test. It's similar to a milestone analysis in the sense that it is a contrast of the later parts of the survival curves, with early events all getting a score of 1. However, unlike the milestone analysis, the contrast does not focus on just one timepoint. Rather, it is an average contrast over late follow-up times with better outomes receiving gradually better scores, and in this sense is more like the log-rank test. 

## Early versus late contrasts

By looking carefully at these graphs we can get a sense about whether a particular test is putting more emphasis on early parts of follow-up or late parts of follow-up. Here, for example, we see that for RMST the scores have a wide range at early follow-up times but do not change at later follow-up times, and vice-versa for the milestone and modestly-weighted tests. The log-rank test has more gradually changing scores across the whole follow-up period.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cowplot::plot_grid(p_rmst, p_lrt,p_mwlrt,p_surv, nrow = 2)
```


# Appendix

## Where do these numbers come from?

In all cases, we can think in the permutation test framework, considering the scores as fixed and permuting the treatment labels.

### (Weighted) log-rank test

Following Leton \& Zuluaga (2000), letting $l_{1,j}$ and $l_{0,j}$ denote the number of patients censored on the test treatment and control treatment, respectively, during $\left[\left.t_j, t_{j+1}\right)\right.$, we can express the (weighted) log-rank statistic as


$$\begin{align*}
U_W &:=\sum_{j = 1}^{k} w_j\left( O_{1,j} - O_j\frac{n_{1,j}}{n_j} \right)\\
  &=\sum_{j = 1}^{k} w_jO_{1,j} - \sum_{j = 1}^{k}w_j\frac{O_{j}}{n_j} \times n_{1,j}\\
  &=\sum_{j = 1}^{k} w_jO_{1,j} - \sum_{j = 1}^{k}w_j\frac{O_{j}}{n_j} \times \sum_{i = j}^{k}(O_{1,i} + l_{1,i})\\
  &=\sum_{j = 1}^{k} w_jO_{1,j} - \sum_{j = 1}^{k}(O_{1,j} + l_{1,j}) \times \sum_{i = 1}^{j}w_i\frac{O_{i}}{n_i}\\
  &=\sum_{j = 1}^{k} O_{1,j}\left( w_j - \sum_{i = 1}^{j}w_i\frac{O_{i}}{n_i} \right) +  \sum_{j = 1}^{k}l_{1,j} \left( - \sum_{i = 1}^{j}w_i\frac{O_{i}}{n_i}\right).
\end{align*}$$

This means that an observed event at time $t_j$ is given a score of $a_i=w_j - \sum_{i = 1}^{j}w_i\frac{O_{i}}{n_i}$, and an observation censored during $\left[\left.t_j, t_{j+1}\right)\right.$ is given a score of $a_i=- \sum_{i = 1}^{j}w_i\frac{O_{i}}{n_i}$.

Note that instead of using $U_W$ one could also use
\begin{equation*}
    \tilde{U}_W = \frac{\sum_{i= 1}^n \mathbb{I}\left\lbrace z_{i} = 1 \right\rbrace a_{i}}{\sum_{i= 1}^n \mathbb{I}\left\lbrace z_{i} = 1 \right\rbrace} - \frac{\sum_{i= 1}^n \mathbb{I}\left\lbrace z_{i} = 0 \right\rbrace a_{i}}{\sum_{i= 1}^n \mathbb{I}\left\lbrace z_{(i)} = 0 \right\rbrace},
\end{equation*}
as the test statistic in a permutation test, as $U$ and $\tilde{U}$ are equivalent up to a (positive) scale and shift transformation, i.e.,
\begin{equation*}
    \tilde{U}_W = \frac{n}{\sum_{i= 1}^n \mathbb{I}\left\lbrace z_{i} = 1 \right\rbrace\sum_{i= 1}^n \mathbb{I}\left\lbrace z_{i} = 0 \right\rbrace} \times U_W - \frac{\sum_{i= 1}^n  a_{i}  \sum_{i= 1}^n \mathbb{I}\left\lbrace z_{i} = 1 \right\rbrace}{\sum_{i= 1}^n \mathbb{I}\left\lbrace z_{i} = 1 \right\rbrace\sum_{i= 1}^n \mathbb{I}\left\lbrace z_{i} = 0 \right\rbrace}.
\end{equation*}

Furthermore, re-scaling the scores to 

$$b_i = \frac{2a_i - \max{a} - \min{a}}{\max{a} - \min{a}}$$
so that $b \in (-1,1)$ would also leave the p-value of the permutation test unchanged.



### RMST / Milestone

We use the concept of pseudo-values following [Andersen et al. (2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.7297).

For the RMST, without any adjustment for covariates, the $i$-th pseudo-value (at time $\tau$) is defined as 
$$\widehat{\theta}_{i}^{\tiny \mbox{RMST}} = n \int_0^\tau \widehat{S}(t) dt - (n-1) \int_0^\tau \widehat{S}^{(-i)}(t) dt,$$
where $\widehat{S}^{(-i)}(t)$ is the Kaplan-Meier estimator excluding observation (or subject) $i$. For the Milestone survival analysis rate, also without any adjustment for covariates, the $i$-th pseudo-value is defined as
$$\widehat{\theta}_{i}^{\tiny \mbox{MLST}} = n \widehat{S}(t) - (n-1) \widehat{S}^{(-i)}(t).$$
Having found pseudo-values for each patient, they can be used just like any other (continuous) outcomes. For example, they could be fed into a linear model with treatment term only. In this case, the resultant test statistic for testing the null hypothesis of zero difference between treatments would be a difference in mean pseudo-values, i.e., the pseudo-values are performing the same role as the "scores" in the weighted log-rank tests. Again these scores could be standardized to lie between -1 and 1 without affecting the p-value.
